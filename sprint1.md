## **Backend**

### **User Stories**

1. Create a database
   This task is done when the developer is able to see a defined database structure within mySql
   ~1h
2. Setup Go dev environment
   This task is done when the developer can run a simple Go program through VSCode
   ~1h
3. Establish database schema
   In mySql, create neccessary key relationships between tables and make sure each table has relevant information
   This task is done when the developer can use SQL queries to navigate through the relational tables created
   ~1h
4. Access the database with go
   Set up Go code to connect to database
   This task is done when connection is working between Go backend and the mySql database
   ~1h
5. Create getClassPosts endpoint on go without logic
   Implement Go logic, setup endpoint, and test that endpoint can send data
   The task is done when within main the get function is set up and linked to a getClassPosts function
   ~1h
6. Add getClassPosts() logic with necessary queries and test cases (sorted by upvote column)
   Create an SQL query to get all posts from a given class ID
   Sort posts by most upvotes
   Send sorted posts object
   Make sure object is running correctly by running tests in command line
   ~1 hour
7. Create addPost() endpoint with logic (make sure to add logic to delete after x downvotes)
   Bind the JSON recevied to a new JSON that will bea dded to the database
   Task is done when there is a specific endpoint that can be called that will add the post to the database
   ~1 hour
8. Create addVote() endpoint with logic
   Task is done when there is a specific endpoint that can be called that will add one vote to a specific post's upvote number via post's ID
   Create an SQL query to get specific post ID and add 1 to the current upvotes of the post
   Send messages back
   ~1 hour
9. Create searchClass() (sorted based on upvotes) endpoint with logic
   Create an SQL query to get all classes and return correct class based on class ID
   Task is done when there is a specific endpoint that can be called that will lists posts based on getClassPoints()
   ~1 hour
10. Create getTrendingClasses endpoint with logic (ranked by total upvotes for all posts)
    Task is done when there is a specific endpoint that can be called to return a sorted list(based on most post upvotes)
    Create a SQL query to get the classes
    Sort post by most upvotes
    Send sorted posts object
    ~1 hour
